I'm not gonna lie: I find it hard to sometimes work on the stuff I
want rather than on the stuff I need. Between work, school and
personal life, the  personal projects I'm often really excited about
just fall by the wayside. Setting up this website was one of them in
fact -- I bought the domain *a full year* before I got down to it
(admittedly during vacation when I had nothing else to do).
In part because I was busy, but also in part because I kept
looking for the *best* static website generator instead of just going
with one of them.

Thinking about how I could improve, I came up with this idea I'm
calling **Daytrips**.
It's nothing more than a commitment mechanism: *no matter what* comes
my way, I will dedicate at least one full day of every weekend to
doing whatever it is I want to work on.

This site,
reading a paper,
studying some theoretical concept,
getting started with a new programming language,
editing pictures from my past trips,
working on some other [project]({{< ref "/projects/" >}})...
The point is *getting it out there* somehow, no matter how crudely.
Each Daytrip should end up with a post or a project page.
Daytrips can and should of course build on top of each other since
I don't want to limit myself to whatever I can do in 16 hours or less.

During the couple of weeks I have left for my current school vacation
(and indeed to my future vacations as well) I'll aim for more than
once a week, but the important thing is it'll *always be at least
once a week*.

I'm excited for how this thing will end up.
It'll be a fun one :)
