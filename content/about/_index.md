My name is Tomaz (pronounced tou-MAS), and I'm a master's student in
Computer Science and Engineering taking the Artificial Intelligence
specialisation at *Politecnico di Milano*. Previously, I was a
bachelor's student in Computer Engineering at the *Escola Politécnica
da Universidade de São Paulo* (Poli-USP).
I was born in and raised in São Paulo, Brazil, before moving to study
in Milan, Italy, where I'm currently based.

I was a research assistant for 1 year at Poli-USP, working with neural network models for time series prediction and classification
along a group with which I published two conference papers.
I also have 1 year of full-time work experience in data analytics and
data engineering.

or my [CV](/cv.pdf) if you'd like to know more.

I'm deeply interested in all aspects of computing, but especially on
how we can make AI systems more efficient, explainable and available
in a way that benefits the most people possible.
I'm always trying to approach things with curiosity in mind, trying
to challenge assumptions about how things are done so we can do them
even better.
Some might also say I'm a bit of an idealist, but I find it hard not
to uphold the strong values I live by: curiosity, independence,
transparency, honesty, to name a few.

In my spare time, I'm usually playing around with computers (as any
good computer nerd would).
I also enjoy
travelling, and meeting new people and cultures along the way;
photography (though I'm no more than just the next guy with a DSLR);
and listening to music from a bunch of my favourite artists
(diehard fan of Sara Bareilles here!).

## About this site
I'm still not sure what I'll make of this just yet.
It'll be where I write up about the behind the scenes of my
[projects]({{< ref "/projects/" >}}) and
[research]({{< ref "/research/" >}}) as they come up,
as well as [post]({{< ref "/posts/" >}}) about any interesting thing
I decide to do or come across.

For now, the main improvement I'd like to make is
set up some page where I can share my pictures and
explain a bit of the story behind them as well.
I also want to play a bit around with Hugo taxonomies so I can get
series of posts rolling.
